Multi AI Agent 🚀

Multi AI Agent is a flexible and powerful application where users can prompt the agent to act as anything (e.g., teacher, coder, researcher, mentor) and then continue interacting through a natural chat interface.
It combines modern AI frameworks, agentic workflows, and cloud-native deployment practices into one end-to-end system.

✨ Features

🔹 Dynamic Role Switching – Ask the agent to act as any persona (e.g., data scientist, doctor, lawyer).

🔹 Conversational Q&A – Chat seamlessly with the agent to get contextual responses.

🔹 Online Search Integration – Retrieve up-to-date information via Tavily search.

🔹 Agentic Reasoning – Build and orchestrate AI agents with LangGraph.

🔹 End-to-End Deployment – CI/CD enabled with Docker, Jenkins, AWS ECS Fargate.

🔹 Quality & Security – Code evaluated with SonarQube for bugs, security issues, and best practices.
